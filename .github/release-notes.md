> feedback is very welcome. **This is a pre-1.0 release, not a finished

### What's new since v0.2.0

Small hotfix batch from user playtest feedback on v0.2.0:

- **Partially fixed: `All unlocked` + a completely fresh EEPROM produced
  silent music/SFX** (D259). A brand-new save slot now seeds max volume the
  same way the N64 does. **However, user testing after this fix still found
  audio (and occasionally right-mouse aim) break when `All unlocked` is
  turned on *before* a save has ever been written** — see the Known Issues
  note below; do not enable it on a fresh install until you've completed at
  least one level normally.
- **Mouse wheel weapon cycling now matches the on-screen wheel-menu order**:
  scroll up = previous weapon, scroll down = next (D260).
- **Watch menu: holding a direction now auto-repeats** instead of crawling
  one item per key press/notch (D261).
- **Fixed: the watch menu's item-preview 3D model wasn't rendering** —
  weapons now show their model when selected on the watch inventory page
  (D264).
- Investigated the Facility report of Ourumov never executing Trevelyan:
  confirmed it's proximity/line-of-sight-triggered exactly as on the N64
  (walk toward the room), not a port bug — the full scripted beat, including
  the execution shot, fires correctly (D263).
- **Removed the `Skip intro` F10 toggle** — user testing found it breaks
  audio. It was already off by default; it's now also pulled from the menu
  entirely until root-caused (D216).
- **Removed the `Screen shake` F10 slider** — it only scaled explosion/effect
  camera shake, not the always-on walking head-bob or any getting-shot
  reaction, so it read as broken/useless. Pulled from the menu until it
  covers all screen-shake/view-bob sources (D181).

### What's new since v0.1.0

- **Drop-in ROM, no tooling**: unpack the bundle, drop your NTSC-U (US) ROM
  in `data/`, launch; the first run generates the derived assets
  automatically. No Python, no installer, nothing to set up.
- **Steady 60 fps** in normal play (the software RSP runs off the presentation
  critical path); `Video.DisplayFPS` in the F10 overlay shows it.
- **Audio**: in-level music and sound effects throughout (the alpha was
  silent). A previous wrong-sounding-instrument bug (bad bass synth on
  Control/Cavern/Runway) is fixed as of v0.2.0.
- **Mouse**: click-to-lock capture (click to grab, ESC to release) with a
  proportional GEPD-style aim mode; sensitivity / Y-inversion / aim-turn split
  tunable in `ge007.ini` or the F10 overlay. The legacy always-grab mode is
  gone.
- **Rendering**: outdoor skies render correctly; water no longer renders
  green/pulsing; reflective surfaces (glass, chrome weapon skins) work.
- **Crash fixes**: the two v0.1.0-era crashing levels (Bunker ii, Statue) and
  the AI-pacing bug that broke Cradle are fixed and playtest-verified: all 21
  solo missions load and run crash-free. Also fixed: the Steam Deck / Linux
  Facility crash triggered by walking into the crouch-forcing spot at the
  level's opening (D253); this also revives the auto-crouch and ladder
  signals, which were dead on PC before.
- **QoL**: F10 in-game options overlay (fullscreen, resolution, frame cap,
  MSAA, texture filtering, FOV/draw distance, sensitivity), F12 screenshot.
- **Sharper defaults out of the box**: draw distance and LOD swap distance now
  default to 150% of the authored N64 values, so props no longer fade in just
  before they become visible (Dam's alarms and wall switches being the tell);
  F10 → *Draw distance* / *LOD distance* set back to 100 restores the
  console-authentic look. MSAA now defaults to 4× instead of off.
- **All-unlocked toggle** *(experimental — see Known Issues before using)*:
  F10 → *All unlocked* makes all 21 solo levels selectable at every
  difficulty, adds 007 mode, and fully populates the cheat menu. It is off by
  default (faithful N64
  progression). No *active* cheats are enabled either way (weapons remain
  per-mission pickups, as on N64).
- **Steam Deck first-run preset**: on SteamOS the first launch seeds
  Deck-friendly defaults (native 1280×800 fullscreen, VSync, MSAA 4, 150%
  draw/LOD distance); an existing `ge007.ini` always wins. **If you first
  launch it in Desktop Mode (e.g. to add it via Steam) before ever running
  it in Game Mode, the preset can be skipped** — an ini gets created before
  Game Mode's Deck-specific environment is detected, and once an ini exists
  it always wins over the preset on every later launch. If your resolution
  isn't 1280×800 on first Game Mode boot, just set it manually: F10 →
  *Resolution* (D283). One more F10 row: *No hit flash* (suppresses the
  damage-flash overlay).
- **Modern dual-stick controller layout** (the scheme used by the console
  re-releases): left stick move/strafe, right stick look, right trigger fire,
  left trigger aim, A/X use, B/Y crouch/cancel, **RB/LB cycle weapons**.
- **Linux / Steam Deck**: the Linux bundle now ships its own SDL2, so it runs
  as-is on any distro, and sideloads onto a Steam Deck with nothing
  installed. Saves and F10 settings now persist no matter which directory you
  launch from (previously Linux wrote them relative to the launch directory
  only, so they silently failed elsewhere; D256); the options overlay is
  fully gamepad-driven on the Deck.

### Known issues

- **Cutscenes still glitch, mostly with James Bond**: in scripted sequences
  Bond is the one who gets misplaced, hovers, or spins; the other actors are
  fine for the most part now. The Dam level-end cutscene is racy (D243).
  Still the most visible gap in this release.
- **Particle colours cycle through a rainbow palette**: bullet-impact sparks
  and lingering smoke/explosion residue drift through the hues over time
  instead of holding their intended grey/orange palette (D252).
- Water on `IsWater` levels shows a moving seam between two patterns (D245);
  thin pixel strips at the left/right screen edges at non-integer window
  scales (D246).
- The front-end **Nintendo logo renders as two white blobs**, and the
  Rareware logo is close but its texture filtering looks off (D75).
- The F10 overlay's **bottom row duplicates whatever item is currently
  selected** (e.g. the MSAA value appears both on its own row and again at
  the panel bottom); earlier builds showed it as an intermittent 4K-
  fullscreen ghost of the top row.
- **Surface 1: the 2D billboard trees near the start render as a solid wall
  of tree texture** instead of discrete sprites (D236). Under active
  investigation; no fix in this release.
- **No true widescreen support**: at 16:9 the game stretches the
  4:3-authored view (world geometry and HUD) rather than properly expanding
  the horizontal field of view. The F10 *FOV scale %* slider is a manual,
  imperfect workaround for the resulting distortion, not real widescreen.
- **No controller rebinding UI, and no macOS or ARM builds.**
- **Distant geometry can drop out on the biggest open levels** (Streets,
  Egyptian) at default FOV — a culling/LOD issue that sometimes
  self-corrects as you keep moving (D249).
- **Gunshot SFX can sound off during sustained/rapid fire**: cadence can
  drift from the N64 original's rate, and PP7/AK47 fire can occasionally go
  silent under heavy automatic fire near another looping sound (e.g. an
  alarm klaxon) (D240/D241).
- **`All unlocked` is highly experimental — do not enable it until you have
  at least one save written.** Complete a level normally first (e.g. Dam on
  Agent), then turn the toggle on. Enabling it on a brand-new install with
  no prior save can still cause silent audio and odd right-mouse-aim
  behavior even after the D259 fix above. We recommend leaving it off unless
  you specifically want the unlock goodies and are willing to accept an
  experimental feature (D259/D257).
- **Linux / Steam Deck: an intermittent SIGSEGV remains, with a reliable
  repro found this release** — Facility's computer terminals, the ones you
  activate to open a door for level progression, consistently crash the
  game when destroyed (D255; not Deck-hardware-specific, seen on Linux
  generally). Confirmed on real Steam Deck hardware across multiple levels:
  every terminal on Facility, terminals near the radio objective on
  Caverns, and a similar crash on Archives when a guard's grenade
  detonates — all point at the same underlying bug (an object record whose
  model reference goes NULL while the record is still active for one more
  tick), triggered by an object exploding/being destroyed rather than by
  simple interaction. Not (yet) reproduced by shooting a room of terminals
  on Frigate, so the trigger isn't purely "destroy any terminal" — still
  under investigation. Please report any other Deck/Linux-specific faults.
- **Steam Deck / gamepad: the right analog stick currently navigates the
  main menu, file select, and mission-select map** — not the left stick.
  This matches the N64 default but is unintuitive on a modern controller;
  moving front-end menu navigation to the left stick is a planned QoL fix,
  not done in this release.

### Downloads

| File | Platform |
|---|---|
| `goldeneye-pc-port-<version>-win64.zip` | Windows x86-64 |
| `goldeneye-pc-port-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` | Linux x86-64 (incl. Steam Deck) |

Each contains the engine executable, a README, license texts, and the
`prepare-assets` tool. **No ROM, no game assets.** The Windows bundle carries
its runtime DLLs; the Linux bundle carries SDL2, so on both platforms nothing
needs to be installed first.

### Running it

You supply your own **GoldenEye 007 N64 ROM** (`.z64`, big-endian) that you
legally own: the **NTSC-U (US)** release is what this build supports (PAL / JP
are on the roadmap). No Python, no toolchain, nothing to install.

1. Unpack the archive.
2. Make a `data/` folder next to the executable and put the ROM in it, named
   `ge007.ntsc-final.z64`.
3. Run the executable **from that folder**. The first run takes a few extra
   seconds: it detects your ROM, generates the two derived asset folders
   (`data/pcmodels-ntsc-final/`, `data/pccg-ntsc-final/`) once, and saves them
   for every future run. (The generator is `prepare-assets/ge007-convert`
   inside the bundle; you can also run it manually; it prints what it's doing.)

**Steam Deck:** sideload the unpacked folder (USB or a file manager), do steps
2–3, then add the executable to Games → *Add Game* as a non-Steam game.

**In-game settings on the Deck:** the options overlay is fully gamepad-driven:
it opens with **Select**, the D-pad or left stick (up/down) moves between
options, **A** steps the selected option forward, **B** steps it back, and
**Start** (or Select again) closes. No keyboard needed.

Full steps are in the bundled `README.md`.
