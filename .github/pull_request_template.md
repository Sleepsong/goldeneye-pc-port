## What this changes

<!-- One or two sentences. Link the issue it closes: "Closes #123". -->

## Why

<!-- The reasoning, not just the diff. What was wrong / missing? -->

## Scope check

- [ ] No changes under `src/` or `include/` — **or** the only changes are
      the narrow `#ifdef PORT` ABI exception (CONTRIBUTING.md rule 2),
      checked against `docs/porting-notes.md` §A1, and documented in
      `docs/dev/findings.md` (§F/D3x).
- [ ] If this PR contains a genuine `src/game` behavior change (not an
      ABI/layout fix): an explicit rule-2 sign-off was granted
      (`docs/dev-process.md` §7) and is recorded in a
      `RULE-2-SIGNOFF`-tagged `docs/dev/findings.md` entry linked here.
- [ ] `Makefile`, `tools/`, `rsp/`, `ld/` untouched (N64 build).
- [ ] If `CMakeLists.txt` `REGION_DEFS` changed, it still matches the N64
      `Makefile` per-region macro set exactly.

## Verification

<!-- What you actually ran. Delete lines that don't apply. -->

- [ ] `./build-pc.sh ntsc-final` — clean configure + link
- [ ] Crash-free run of at least one level (`-level_09`)
- [ ] Single-frame `GE_PCDUMP` diff against the committed golden — no
      unexpected change
- [ ] pal-final / jpn-final also configured

Platform tested: <!-- e.g. Windows 10 / MSYS2 MINGW64 -->

## Notes for the reviewer

<!-- Anything uncertain, follow-ups, or areas that need a closer look. -->
